# Put in debug mode

Debugging tests can be hard sometimes and it is very useful to be able to pause tests in order to inspect the browser. Jest Puppeteer exposes a method `jestPuppeteer.debug()` that suspends test execution and gives you opportunity to see what's going on in the browser.

```js
await jestPuppeteer.debug()
```
