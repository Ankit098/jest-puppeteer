# Writing tests using Puppeteer

Writing integration test can be done using [Puppeteer API](<(https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)>) but it can be complicated and hard because API is not designed for testing.

To make it simpler, [expect-puppeteer API](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer/tree/master/packages/expect-puppeteer/README.md#api) add some specific matchers if you make expectation on a [Puppeteer Page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-page).

Some examples:

### Writing tests using Puppeteer

Writing integration test can be done using [Puppeteer API](<(https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md)>) but it can be complicated and hard because API is not designed for testing.

To make it simpler, [expect-puppeteer API](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer/tree/master/packages/expect-puppeteer/README.md#api) add some specific matchers if you make expectation on a [Puppeteer Page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#class-page).

Some examples:

#### Find a text in the page

```js
// Assert that current page contains 'Text in the page'
await expect(page).toMatch('Text in the page')
```

#### Click a button

```js
// Assert that a button containing text "Home" will be clicked
await expect(page).toClick('button', { text: 'Home' })
```

#### Fill a form

```js
// Assert that a form will be filled
await expect(page).toFillForm('form[name="myForm"]', {
  firstName: 'James',
  lastName: 'Bond',
})
```
