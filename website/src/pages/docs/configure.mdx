# Configure Puppeteer

Jest Puppeteer automatically detects the best config to start Puppeteer but sometimes you may need to specify custom options. All Puppeteer [launch](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions) or [connect](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteerconnectoptions) options can be specified in `jest-puppeteer.config.js` at the root of the project. Since it is JavaScript, you can use all the stuff you need, including environment.

The browser context can be also specified. By default, the browser context is shared. `incognito` is available if you want more isolation between running instances. More information available in [jest-puppeteer-environment readme](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer/blob/master/packages/jest-environment-puppeteer/README.md)

```js
// jest-puppeteer.config.js
module.exports = {
  launch: {
    dumpio: true,
    headless: process.env.HEADLESS !== 'false',
  },
  browserContext: 'default',
}
```
